Hello there!

This is a simple repository to show some of the things I made for fun.

## Space Distortion

Distorting space in a manner that isn't doable outside of computer graphics is something that always fascinated me. This is an example of vertex displacement and deformation to create an effect akin to gravity, or reality, bending to clear a sphere around a position. Notice how some objects are moved completely and how some on the green perimeter are only deformed within the perimeter. 

Taken further, the same code can be applied to deform a terrain, and with an added particle system to represent a ring around the perimeter, it now looks like this:
